<p>The year is 2099. Intruder organisms have begun a full-scale invasion of Earth. The hive is targeting densely populated urban centers. You must contain the infection before mass assimilation.</p>

<p>CLICK HERE to initiate defensive maneuvers!</p>
<p>(Instructions: Click to incinerate intruder organisms before they infiltrate the city! Each sucessful intercept depletes the swarm's score by 10 points and increases the city's score, while each hit on the city decreases our score by 10 points. If the city reaches zero, the swarm will be unstoppable!)</p>
